General Topic/Overview: **Contextualizing Sports Absurdities and
Performance**

For this report, the focus is on contextualizing the extraordinary and
historic achievement of Gretchen Walsh’s record-breaking 100 butterfly

**Important Notes/Abbreviations:**

swims take place in pools/lane that are 25 yards in length. This differs
